# GoASCII

GoASCII is a CLI tool that converts images to ASCII art. It supports various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and GIF.

## Installation

To install GoASCII, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cosmoblade/goascii.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd goascii
   ```
3. Run the installation script:
   ```
   ./build.sh
   ```
   This will compile the Go code and install the `goascii` binary to `/usr/local/bin/`.

## Usage

To use GoASCII, run the following command:

```
goascii <input.png/jpg> <output.txt> [--width=100] [--height=50]
```

- `<input.png/jpg>`: The path to the input image file.
- `<output.txt>`: The path to the output ASCII art file.
- `--width=100`: (Optional) The target width of the ASCII art in characters.
- `--height=50`: (Optional) The target height of the ASCII art in characters.

Example:

```
goascii image.png output.txt --width=100 --height=50
```

This will convert the `image.png` file to ASCII art and save it to the `output.txt` file, with a target size of 100 characters wide and 50 characters tall.
